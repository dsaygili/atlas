# Introduction
Atlas, a 2D open-source fantasy RPG game where users create their own characters and embark on a journey of learning a new language with preset languages or custom languages (see `Custom Langauge Configuration`).
In the game users will interact with NPCs in dialouge, play mini-games, and gain XP/rewards. 
The founder, Deniz Saygili, is a 28-year old Economics graduate from Toronto Metropolitan University with 5+ yrs of working in the finance industry with a keen interest in easing the language learning process globally. Deniz knows English, Turkish, (actively learning) French. The game was inspired by Deniz's french intensive program registration in Universit√© Laval (Canada's oldest university), where Deniz took a month vacation from work to learn french.
